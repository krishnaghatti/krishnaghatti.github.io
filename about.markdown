### Hello World!

My name is Sri Krishna. I am a __Devops engineer__. Within the devops domain I have worked on Linux server administration, Configuration management, Cloud technologies - IaaS, PaaS and to some extent SaaS and tool development mainly in python.

Apart from that I like to tinker around with my home lab setup, listen to classic rock songs by Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Neil Young and a lot more like these. I am a big  movie buff. I love movies, so if anything is short of my expectation I do not watch it :D.

__Animation__ is my other hobby and I do sketch a little. Some day I would like to animate my own characters. As a kid I used to follow Disney, Pixar and Tom and Jerry cartoons. As I grew up my interest in animation grew though it has not reached a level of taking up as my primary work. Hobbies and career are two different things! Each of these have to be treated with due respect individually.

Thank you for stopping by but do stick around and lets see how deep this rabbit hole goes.
