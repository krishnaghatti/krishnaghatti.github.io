Don't get me wrong. I am fine to get informative ads. It becomes a bit hard when I am hit with a bunch of irrelevant ones and the amount of tracking that happens in the background.
I initially used adblock plugins on the browser - which work fine to certain extent. But if I have to block it completely I have to use a Pi-hole setup.

`Pi-hole` is a DNS level ad blocker. Once up and set as the DNS server of the local network, it blocks out all the DNS queries from the client that are trying to resolve any domains that server ads. All this is done without installing any software on the client side.
The name Pi-hole comes from the fact that this is usually run as a service on a Raspberry Pi a small all-in-one PC.

I have a Raspberry-pi that I used to setup Pi-hole at my home. I added the Pi node as my DNS server in my router for my local network. This blocks all the ads on all the devices on my network and also give me a view of each client activity(if enabled). The setup works great on clients connected over wi-fi or ethernet to the router. But how to block the ads and unwanted domains when on mobile network?

For this I have to run the pi-hole service on a public cloud and use that as a DNS resolver on my phone. If I open up port 53 on the cloud VM to the world (which is required as the public IP of the client from where the requests are coming will keep changing), it can be used for [DNS amplification attacks][dns-amp] and also I will be incurring a cost for the amount of network ingress the node gets which I am not willing to pay at this moment.

To over come this I used [Wireguard VPN][wireguard] server on the cloud node. I connected my mobile to the cloud node's network via a dedicated VPN tunnel. This avoids the need of:
1. Having a public IP on the DNS server
2. Removes the challenge of blocking unwanted queries.

The VPN client on my mobile opens a tunnel to my cloud VM and uses the private IP of the Pi-hole setup as the DNS server.
The below screenshot is with and with out ads for comparison.

This setup is up for over 10 days and I am very happy with the outcome. Pi-hole also has a web UI that is available out of the box and gives stats of each client and the number of ads blocked by the system. Below is a screenshot of the stats over a 24 hour period and yes **34.7% of my DNS queries on my mobile are related to ads!!**

Neat right. In follow-up posts I will be detailing the technical aspects along with the configuration.

<!-- The setup can be done with [OpenVPN server][pi-vpn] -->
