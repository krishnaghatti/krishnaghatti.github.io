## Old sketches

  Some of my old sketches with a little bit of back ground story.

- ### The famous boardless coffee hotel
This was on a book of [Malgudi Days][malgudidays]. The original sketch is by the one and only [R. K. Laxman][rklaxman]

- ### Ji Mantriji
This is from the title sequence of an old Hindi TV serial Ji Mantriji - an Indian adaptation of the famous BBC series Yes Minister! The original sketch is again by [R. K. Laxman][rklaxman]

- ### Swami
This is again from the cover of Swami and his friends by [R. K. Laxman][rklaxman].
Don't mind the twisted leg. Trust me the original was a lot better.

- ### Education
One of my uncle A.R.K. Prasad (who unfortunately is no longer with us) was a lecturer who used to get greetings from various college and magazine communities. On one Teachers day he got a greeting with the original of this sketch along with a copy of a [letter][letter] by Abraham Lincoln written to his son's teacher.
